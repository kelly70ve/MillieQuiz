# 04 Web APIs: Millie Quiz

This is an app that has multiple-choice questions and interactive challenges. It is a timed quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

This project has been completed, but can use some touching up and debugging. This project is responsive and can be viewed on mobile, tablet, or desktop [here](https://kelly70ve.github.io/MillieQuiz/).
